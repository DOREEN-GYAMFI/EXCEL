# Multiregional Retail Operations Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of a retail company's multiregional operations across London, Oxford, and Manchester, focusing on optimizing pricing strategies to enhance Return on Investment (ROI). The analysis is based on datasets encompassing sales transactions, pricing information, and regional specifics for three consecutive years (2021-2023).

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this analysis include:

- Analyzing the impact of varying price lists on sales performance and ROI within each distribution area.
- Identifying correlations between pricing strategies and consumer behavior in different regions.
- Developing predictive models to forecast potential ROI based on revised pricing structures.
- Recommending optimal price points for each distribution area to enhance ROI in 2024.

## Tools and Techniques Used

### Data Preprocessing
- Utilized Excel's INDEX and MATCH functions to merge datasets, fetching prices based on year and distribution location.
- Calculated total sales figures by multiplying price and quantity purchased for each transaction.

### Findings and Analysis
- Identified trends in sales performance across the three regions (London, Oxford, Manchester) over the three-year period (2021-2023).
- Conducted correlation analysis between price, quantity, and sales to understand consumer behavior.

### Predictive Modeling
- Employed regression models for each region to predict sales based on price and quantity variables.
- Extracted insights into the impact of price adjustments and quantity sold on sales and ROI.

## Recommendations

### Region-Specific Strategies
- London: Cautious price increases and a focus on boosting sales volume for increased ROI.
- Manchester: Balanced pricing strategies to leverage price impact without compromising quantity sold.
- Oxford: Moderate price adjustments coupled with efforts to increase quantity sold for optimal revenue.

### General Strategies
- Dynamic Pricing: Implementing adaptive pricing strategies considering market demand and competitor pricing.
